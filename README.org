** Note

[[file:./sc.png]]

This is a fork of org-roam-ui, thanks to the great work of the org-roam-ui author,
what I only need to do, is feed the data to the frontend webpage. which means, I only
need to develop a plugin for neovim istead of emacs, like the org-roam-ui.el file do.

And *CaryWill/org-roam.nvim* is also a forked project.

** Installation

1. install this neovim plugin.

Plug 'CaryWill/org-roam-ui.nvim'
Plug 'CaryWill/org-roam.nvim'

2. globally install neovim npm package.
I tried to use lua websocket module, but it's so hard to install, so I quit,
I used nodejs to develop neovim org-roam-ui server.

so please run to install neovim node host: `npm install -g neovim`

3. start up the frontend page.

Go to your neovim plugin directory and cd into `org-roam-ui.nvim` then run `npm install --force` then `npm run dev` to start the frontend page.
Mine is in: ~/.local/share/nvim/plugged

4. make org-roam websocket connect to your org-roam-ui

run in vim command line: =:InitWs=

** What is Supported?
   It only support the graph view and note view for now, because it's the only
   thing I needed for now, PR are welcome.

  1. You can view notes in the web browser.(image also)
